# C++  Automated  Testing  Assistant  Tool

## Brief Introduction

This tool is used to assist automation in C++code testing. Before using this tool, please ensure that a functional C++solution and testing environment have been set up. For example, corresponding third-party libraries such as GoogleTest and sqlite3 that may be used in the code were built and linked through the Visual Studio project.

## Environmental Requirements

1. **Solution Code**: This contains the C++code you need to test
2. **Test Code**: This contains your testing code.
3. **Development Environment**: It is recommended to use Visual Studio and ensure that the C++development package and third-party libraries (such as GoogleTest and sqlite3) are installed.

## Instructions

1. **Update file path**

   Edit the`total.h`file and update the following path to the corresponding file location in your environment:

   ```cpp
   const std::string solution_file = "Your solution code path\\pch.h";
   const std::string test_file = "Your test code path\\test.cpp";
   ```

2. **Configure compilation commands**

   In the ` build_project ` function, modify the following to the corresponding path and command in your environment:

   ```cpp
   // Configure Visual Studio Command Prompt Path
   const std::string vs_cmd_prompt = "The path where your VsDevCMD.bat is located";
   
   // Enter the project directory
   std::string cd_to_project = "cd /d \"Your project path\"";
   
   // Enter the target directory generated by compilation
   std::string cd_to_build = "cd /d \"Your project path\\x64\\Debug\"";
   
   // Compile using msbuild
   std::string build_command = "msbuild Your project.sln /p:Configuration=your Configuration/p:Platform=your Platform";
   
   // 执行测试代码
   std::string print_command = "Your executable file name.exe";
   ```

3. **Provide test files**

   Put the files to be tested into the Test\toube_tested folder in the main.cpp folder, with the format required to be in the to-be_tested folder. The code translated from different large models should be placed in different folders, such as deepseek_py2cpp, codellama_java2cpp, etc. Each such folder should contain the organized code to be tested.

4. **Run Test**

   After completing the above modifications, running this tool will automatically compile and execute tests, facilitating automated testing.

5. **View Results**

   After the entire testing is completed, users can find a result file in the corresponding folder in to-be_tested, which stores the individual compilation results of the solution code to be tested (in the format of a JSON file); The running results of successfully compiled code can also be found in the result folder under the compute_passed folder in the Test folder (also in JSON format). Among them, result.jsonl stores the test information of all test points passing through, while result2.json stores the test information of the test suite.


## Points for Attention

- Ensure that the required third-party libraries (such as GoogleTest, sqlite3, etc.) are installed and configured correctly.
- The path and commands should be adjusted according to your actual environment to ensure smooth compilation and testing of the project.
